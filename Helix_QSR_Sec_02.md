🧩 SECTION 2 — REFLEXIVE ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT
Document Type: Technical Specification
System: Helix QSR (Quality Score Rubric)
Focus: Structural & Cognitive Reflexivity

🧠 Purpose
The Reflexive Architecture Blueprint (RAB) defines how the Helix QSR integrates metacognitive reflection into its system design — enabling the model to both evaluate and improve its own cognitive performance through feedback loops embedded at every operational layer.
This section outlines the architectural components, flow mechanisms, and design rationale that allow QSR to achieve quantitative self-awareness.

⚙️ Architectural Principles
    1. Recursive Validation — Every subsystem validates not only its outputs but the logic behind its own validation.
    2. Symmetrical Observability — Monitoring tools observe both system behavior and their own observational reliability.
    3. Cognitive Transparency — Self-evaluation results are exposed as structured data (JSON schemas, metrics) for interpretability.
    4. Dynamic Reflection — Feedback loops continuously adapt the evaluation criteria based on performance drift or context shifts.
    5. Fail-Gracefully Reflexive — When uncertain, the system defaults to human verification rather than silent assumptions.

🧩 Core Components Overview
Component	Description	Reflexive Function
Evaluator	Calculates coherence, accuracy, novelty, and relevance	Generates QSR Scores per output
Reflector	Interprets Evaluator metrics and identifies patterns	Self-assessment & improvement insight
Governor	Applies policies based on self-scores (e.g., flagging, rate limiting)	Safety enforcement & adaptive control
Recorder	Logs all reflection events and score histories	Enables longitudinal introspection
Human Bridge	Interface for human feedback integration	Ensures value alignment and trust

Description:
This loop forms the Reflexive Core.
Every decision made by QSR is later used to update the evaluator’s criteria — achieving a live, learning architecture that improves not just outputs, but judgment quality itself.

🧮 Reflexivity Matrix
Reflexivity Tier	Description	Mechanism	Human Role
Level 1 — Reactive	Detects and flags low-quality outputs	Static scoring	Reviewer validation
Level 2 — Reflective	Analyzes patterns in its own scoring	Adaptive scoring updates	Feedback integration
Level 3 — Metacognitive	Evaluates its own evaluation accuracy	Recursive score audits	Governance oversight
Level 4 — Collaborative	Harmonizes self-reflection with human evaluation data	Weighted alignment algorithm	Co-learning participant

📦 System Interfaces
interfaces:
  evaluator_api:
    input: model_output
    output: qsr_score_object
    version: v1.2.3
  reflector_module:
    input: qsr_score_object
    output: evaluation_adjustment
  governor_service:
    input: evaluation_adjustment
    output: safety_action | advisory_flag
  recorder_db:
    input: reflection_event
    output: metrics_log
Integration Notes:
    • All interfaces communicate over secured internal APIs.
    • QSR operates in advisory mode by default.
    • Score-to-policy binding is configurable via YAML or control dashboard.

🧩 Reflexive Architecture Design Notes
    • Self-Reference Integrity: Avoid infinite recursion by limiting introspection depth.
    • Transparency by Default: Each decision must be explainable at runtime.
    • Metric Calibration: Maintain score normalization across time and context.
    • Reflective Drift Detection: Alert if evaluation quality deviates beyond tolerance.

🧭 Design Outcomes
    • Systems observe themselves observing.
    • Self-evaluation becomes measurable, traceable, and improvable.
    • Reflexivity transitions from an abstract concept to a living architectural property.
